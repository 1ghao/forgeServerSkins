# Forge Server Skins

Forge Server Skins is a simple server side forge mod which implements the /skin command to minecraft, enabling players
to change their skins using /skin <targetUsername>. It also saves the skins in a local config so they are saved upon
player disconnect or server restart.

## Missing features
- Automatic skin on first join
- Skin reset flag
